## Hi there 👋

I'm a somewhat new developer who valudes his privacy very much. This is not my main GitHub account nor will I link to it, for privacy reasons. On this account, I plan to develop a revolutionary YouTube alternative called Stellicast. I have no clue how long it will take to reach the MVP or if it will succeed in it's goal, but someone has to try. Yes, I'm aware that there are already many YouTube alternatives, but none of them meet my vision or needs for a YouTube alternative.
