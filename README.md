## Hi there 👋

I'm a somewhat new developer who valudes his privacy very much. This is not my main GitHub account nor will I link to it, for privacy reasons. On this account, I had planned to develop a revolutionary YouTube alternative but decided to do it on my [main GitHub account](https://github.com/Zytronium) instead. I have no clue how long it will take to reach the MVP or if it will succeed in it's goal, but someone has to try. Yes, I'm aware that there are already many YouTube alternatives, but none of them meet my vision or needs for a YouTube alternative.

While I won't be using this account, I decided to keep it for SEO reasons.
